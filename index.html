                <h2>My Journey in Computer Science</h2>
                <p>As I stepped onto the campus of Texas Southern University (TSU) for the first time, I felt a mixture of excitement and trepidation. It was a warm August morning, and the hustle and bustle of students moving into dorms, finding classes, and reuniting with friends filled the air with an electric buzz. I clutched my backpack, filled with fresh notebooks and high hopes, ready to embark on my journey as a computer science student.

                    The first few weeks were a whirlwind. The introductory courses were packed with eager faces, all of us brimming with enthusiasm to dive into the world of algorithms, data structures, and coding languages. Our professors were not just teachers but mentors who were deeply invested in our success. Dr. Hayes, my first programming professor, had a way of making even the most complex concepts seem approachable. His passion was contagious, and I found myself spending hours in the computer lab, practicing code and debugging programs.
                    
                    However, as the semester progressed, the challenges began to mount. The coursework was rigorous, and balancing it with part-time work was daunting. I remember one particular week when I had three major assignments due and a midterm exam to study for. Sleep became a luxury, and the stress felt overwhelming. I questioned my decision to pursue computer science, wondering if I was truly cut out for this demanding field.
                    
                    It was during one of those late-night study sessions in the library that I met Jasmine. She was a fellow computer science major, equally passionate and equally stressed. We quickly formed a study group, and our sessions became a lifeline. We shared tips, solved problems together, and celebrated each other's successes. Jasmine introduced me to hackathons, and that opened up a whole new world of practical learning and networking. Together, we participated in the TSU Hackathon, where we developed a mobile app to help students find study partners. We didn’t win, but the experience was exhilarating and cemented my love for problem-solving and innovation.
                    
                    My sophomore year brought more advanced courses and even more challenges. The Algorithms and Data Structures class was infamous for its difficulty, and I soon understood why. The concepts were abstract and required a deep level of understanding and application. There were moments of frustration when my code wouldn’t run as expected, and I’d spend hours searching for a single missing semicolon or a misplaced bracket. But those moments also taught me perseverance and the importance of attention to detail.
                    
                    One of the most rewarding experiences came from working on a research project with Dr. Roberts, focusing on artificial intelligence. We explored machine learning algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios. This project was a turning point for me, as it sparked a keen interest in AI and its potential to solve complex problems. Presenting our findings at the university’s research symposium was a proud moment, and it reinforced my belief in the power of teamwork and dedication.
